# CookingBuddy
## Background
Cooking Buddy is an application that has been designed with the intention to promote learning and developement of culinary skills.
## Client
Our team took interest in developing this application after witnessing people in our lives struggling to find effective solutions to preparing meals in ways that are creative, cost effective and nutritional. Our goal is to inspire people to share their own talents and present newer users with the skills to enhance their cooking experience. 
## Technology
Our system is built on a Blazor "web" application and may implement various API's in future versions in order to enhance user experience. Please contact our DevOps administrator for any necessary access keys.
## Usage
Ideally, Cooking Buddy should be able to assist users with every step of creating a meal - from finding a recipe, to
eventually preparing it. There should be assistance for users to search for recipes or find recommendations in order
to find a recipe that best suits their circumstances. On the other hand, a user should be able to share their own
recipes as well if they wish to do so.
Aside from simply providing recipes, it should also offer a variety of supporting features that optimize the user
experience - in the sense that the application should be usable by individuals outside of those who are familiar with
technology and the art of cooking. Relating to this point, resources should be available to educate users on the
foundational knowledge needed for cooking-related tasks. Following the completion of a meal, users should have the
option to save these recipes for future use, or leave feedback on what they liked or disliked about the dish
